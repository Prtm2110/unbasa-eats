# ScrapBot

## Overview

This repository contains a web scraping and data processing project designed to collect restaurant data from various sources, construct a knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and provide a user-friendly interface for querying this data. The project utilizes Python, FastAPI for the backend, and React for the frontend.

## Features

-   **Web Scraping:** Collects data from specified restaurant sources.
-   **Knowledge Base Construction:** Processes scraped data and builds a vector store for efficient querying using RAG techniques.
-   **FastAPI Backend:** Serves the processed data and handles RAG-based queries via API endpoints, including WebSocket support for chat.
-   **React Frontend:** Provides an interactive user interface for asking questions, chatting with the bot (with session management), viewing restaurant details, and browsing menus.
-   **RAG Implementation:** Allows users to ask natural language questions about restaurants (general or specific), compare prices, check for dietary options (e.g., gluten-free), and more, leveraging the constructed knowledge base.
-   **Docker Support:** Includes Docker configuration for simplified setup and deployment.
-   **Data Processing & Storage:** Manages the storage and retrieval of restaurant information and menu items.
-   **Logging & Error Handling:** Implements basic logging and error management.
-   **Configuration Management:** Uses configuration files for managing settings.
