# Restaurant RAG Chatbot Architecture

## Overview

The Zomato Restaurant RAG Chatbot is designed to provide users with information about restaurants, their menus, and features using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The architecture consists of several components that work together to scrape restaurant data, process it into a knowledge base, and serve it through a FastAPI backend.

  - **raw/**: Raw scraped data.
  - **processed/**: Processed data ready for use.

- **frontend/**: Vite+React frontend for the chatbot interface. 

- **logs/**: Directory for log files generated by the application.

- **models/**: Contains model files, including indices for the knowledge base.
  - **index/**: Directory for storing the index files.

## Components Description

### API

- **backend.py**: Sets up the FastAPI server, handles incoming requests, and serves static files. It defines endpoints for chatting with the bot and retrieving restaurant information.

### Chatbot

- **chatbot.py**: Implements the main chatbot logic, integrating the retriever and generator components.
- **conversation.py**: Manages the conversation history for each user session.
- **generator.py**: Uses AI to generate responses based on retrieved information.
- **retriever.py**: Retrieves relevant documents from the knowledge base based on user queries.

### Knowledge Base

- **indexer.py**: Creates an index for quick lookups of restaurant data.
- **processor.py**: Processes raw data into a structured format suitable for the knowledge base.

### Scraper

- **scraper.py**: Contains the logic for scraping restaurant data from specified URLs.
- **helper.py**: Provides utility functions for cleaning and processing scraped data.

### Utilities

- **exceptions.py**: Defines custom exceptions for error handling.
- **logger.py**: Configures logging for the application.

## Conclusion

The Zomato Restaurant RAG Chatbot is a modular and extensible application that leverages web scraping, AI, and a structured knowledge base to provide users with accurate and relevant restaurant information. The architecture is designed to be user-friendly and maintainable, allowing for easy updates and enhancements in the future.
